# Surgical_Simulator_with_Visual_Force
This is a surgical simulator platform that proves the effectiveness of improving robotic surgical teleoperation by providing vision-derived visual force plot to the human operator. This concept is a variation of perception complementary and provides great potential for ensuring the security and robustness in cyber-physical systems.

Program is tested with MATLAB 2013.

Run code by executing the main.m file.
